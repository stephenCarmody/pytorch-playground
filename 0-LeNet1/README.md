## Objective 
The goal of this notebook was to recreate Yann Le Cuns papers: Handwritten Digit Recognitiion with a Back Propagation Network [1989] using PyTorch.

## Notes
Although not mentioned explicitly in the paper, I use Tanh's for the hidden layers and Sigmoids for the fully connected layers as that's what was commonly used for activation functions in the literature at the time.
